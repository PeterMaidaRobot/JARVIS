# JARVIS
## Just A Rather Very Intelligent System

### Setup (Mac)
- In the home (~) directory, type the command: "sudo nano .bash_profile".
- Type "alias jarvis='~/Developer/JARVIS/jarvis'" in the document, changing the path to be wherever the repository got cloned to.
- Switch to the directory and change the executable permissions with "cd ~/Developer/JARVIS/jarvis", or wherever the repository path is, and change permissions with "chmod +x jarvis".

### Current Status
- "Hello Sir" printed upon running the jarvis command
